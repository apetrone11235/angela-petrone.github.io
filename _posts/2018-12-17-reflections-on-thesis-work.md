There is something a bit cringey about reading something I wrote nearly four years ago, but I felt it was important to take a serious look back at what was my most significant academic exercise in college. My motivation for choosing a topic on healthcare reform was because in 2014, the US was in the midst of the implementation of the ACA and I thought that the economic ramifications would be a widely discussed in college and graduate theses. I had known since my first internship that I wanted to focus my thesis work on healthcare but wanted to pick something a little out of the ordinary where I could set myself the additional challenge of learning about a new culture, government, and way of creating policy. After seeking guidance, I decided to work with two economics professors who could each provide unique insight into different aspects of my project.

To provide some context, here is the abstract from my paper:

The key premise of this paper and politcal thought at the time (especially in the US) was that giving people more comprehensive health insurance would improve overall health outcomes. Intuitively, this makes sense, and after working as a health insurance underwriter for three years, I have seen first hand how insurance mitigates catastrophic loss.
