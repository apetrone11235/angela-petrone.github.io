This afternoon, it was officially announced that Bryce Harper signed with the Phillies. He will make $330M over the next 13 years which is the largest contract in MLB history. This enormous contract should not have come as too much of a suprise after Manny Machado signed with the Padres a few weeks ago for $300M over 10 years, but there is something about seeing a 13 year contract that feels borderling insane. Not only will Harper be 39 (which is basically dead in baseball years) when his contract is up, but 13 years is longer than he's been in the majors. In my mind, it's a huge gamble that ties up a lot of our financial resources that could be better allocated (i.e. improving our bullpen).

There is a lot of speculation what the new lineup will look like, but it seems most likely that he will hit 3rd or 4th. It is not clear what Rhys Hoskins' role would be if Harper hits cleanup or how effective Harper would be hitting right before Hoskins, but suffice it to say, there will be a lot of trial and error before our optimal lineup is set. 

This deal has already drawn a lot of praise and ire from around the baseball world, not just about whether it was a smart move for the Phillies, but also regarding what it will do for the contract market in the future. 

If this project has taught me anything, it's that predicting performance over time is very difficult. Putting a value on projected performance more than a decade away feels downright impossible. 

However, I recognize that the Phillies front office is made up of competent baseball professionals who put a lot of thought into this deal. At the end of the season, I hope I have been proven wrong.
