_"Life is too long to say anything definitely; always say perhaps"_ - _Leo Tolstoy_

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Angela and welcome to my little website where I publish fun and random personal data projects. I started posting here in 2018 as a way of practicing and sharing my self-learning in R. I like working with data and generally trying to predict the future.

I grew up in Philadelphia and then moved to Boston to attend Boston College where I graduated in 2015 with a degree in Economics and a minor in Mathematics. I stuck around after graduation and got my first full-time job at CNA as an underwriter. I learned a lot about the insurance industry and saw first-hand the data problems large insurers faced. In 2019, I wanted to put my technical degree and industry knowledge to use and so I moved into catastrophe modeling at Verisk Extreme Event Solutions (formerly AIR Worldwide). As I learned more and grew in my role, I took on more responsiblity to oversee consulting work for some of our biggest clients and took charge of our data services group with the aim to streamline the process of getting big and messy data into our model. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to lead the _Insurance Industry Charitable Foundation_ as the Associate Board Chairman in Boston. In the summer of 2022, I was tired of being cold all the time and moved back to the Philly area, thanks to the magic of remote work.

I love long books and long runs. I'm an 8x marathoner and have more planned! When I'm not running, you can catch me on the dance floor of your local salsa club, cheering on the Phillies, or getting lost in a book (or on the street...I'm not great with directions).
