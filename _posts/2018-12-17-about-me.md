I am originally from Philadelphia and moved up to Boston for college. I graduated from Boston College in 2015 and immediately started to work as a medical malpractice underwriter at CNA. At the end of 2017, I made a lateral move to the Surety department in my office in order to learn about corporate finance and expand my risk analysis knowledge. 

In my spare time, I am an avid distance runner, ballroom dancer and oboist. I also dedicate my time to serving on two young professionals boards: Back on My Feet Boston and the Insurance Industry Charitable Foundation. I take my responsibilities within these organizations very seriously because I am a big believer in the importance of corporate social responsibility and community partnerships. These beliefs were instilled in me when I was an intern at the Independence Blue Cross Foundation where I was able to see the impact of our work in the community by visiting health clinics that had been opened because of our financial support.

During college, my studies were influenced by the Jesuit ideal of cura personalis (in the context of Jesuit universities, this is the idea that students should have a well-rounded education). This led me to study a wide variety of subjects and ultimately do my thesis work on the impact of health insurance policy reform in China, looking at it not only from an economic aspect but also from a social and cultural perspective. I believe that it is only through the confluence of understanding these elements that effective policy can be created and I created this website so that I had a place to express my views and research in this area.
