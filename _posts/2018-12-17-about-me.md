_"Life is too long to say anything definitely; always say perhaps"_ - _Leo Tolstoy_

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Angela and welcome to my little website where I publish fun and random personal data projects. I started posting here in 2018 as a way of practicing and sharing my self-learning in R. I like working with data and generally trying to predict the future.

I grew up in Philadelphia and then moved to Boston to attend Boston College where I graduated in 2015 with a degree in Economics and a minor in Mathematics. I stuck around after graduation and got my first full-time job at CNA as an underwriter. I learned a lot about the insurance industry and saw first-hand the data problems large insurers faced. In 2019, I wanted to put my technical degree and industry knowledge to use and so I moved into catastrophe modeling at Verisk Extreme Event Solutions (formerly AIR Worldwide). As I grew in my role, I became responsible for overseeing consulting work for some of our biggest clients. I also took charge of our main data process which controls how big and messy data gets prepped for modelling and loaded into our tool. During this time, I was also asked to lead the _Insurance Industry Charitable Foundation_ as the Associate Board Chairman in Boston which was an extremely fun and rewarding experience. In the summer of 2022, I was tired of being cold all the time and really missed my family, so I left Boston and moved back to the Philly area thanks to the magic of remote work.

Outside of work, I love long books and long runs. I'm an 8x marathoner and have more planned! When I'm not running, you can catch me on the dance floor of my local salsa club, cheering on the Phillies, or getting lost in a book (or on the street...I'm not great with directions).
