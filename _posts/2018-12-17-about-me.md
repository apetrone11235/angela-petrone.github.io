Hello and thank you for visiting my website. My name is Angela and I am originally from Philadelphia. I moved up to Boston to attend Boston College where I graduated in 2015 with a degree in Economics and a minor in Mathematics. After graduation, I joined CNA as an underwriter where I learned a lot about the insurance industry and saw first had the data problems large insurers faced. In 2019, I wanted to put my technical degree and industry knowledge to use and so I moved into catastrophe modeling at Verisk Extreme Event Solutions (formerly AIR Worldwide). As I learned more and grew in my role, I took on more responsiblity to oversee consulting work for some of our biggest clients and took charge of our data services group with the aim to streamline the process of getting big and messy data into our model.

In my spare time, I am an avid distance runner, ballroom dancer, and love playing piano. I also dedicate my time to chairing the _Insurance Industry Charitable Foundation_ Associate Board. I am a big believer in the importance of corporate social responsibility and partnerships between large companies and not-for-profits. These beliefs were instilled in me when I was an intern at the Independence Blue Cross Foundation during college because I was able to see the impact of our work in the community by visiting health clinics that had been opened because of the grants we provided. Since then, I have been especially interested in exploring what large  companies can do for the communities they serve.
