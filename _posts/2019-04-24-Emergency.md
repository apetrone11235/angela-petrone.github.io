As you can see, my initial assumption about emergency room visits decreasing was incorrect. Seeing these graphs left me with a lot of questions, primarily, why are visits on the rise and why did the implementation of the ACA not have any noticeable effect of the overall trend? I have also been confused by mixed information online whether or not emergency room visits are rising or falling.

DO LIT REVIEW HERE (keep it brief - just some examples of ones that are opposing)
