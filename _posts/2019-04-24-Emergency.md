On a chilly spring day in 2017, I got a call from my roommate. I was in my office and immediately knew that something was wrong because, as two twentysomething girls, we never talked on the phone. When I picked up, her voice was strained and nearly overwhelmed by background noise. She had been rock climbing at a local gym with some friends when she had fallen and landed awkwardly on her arm. Despite her best attempts to convince the group to let her get an Uber to the hospital, someone had called an ambulance and she was in transit to the nearest emergency room.

As I got on the subway to meet her at the hospital, I realized that I had only been to the emergency room twice in my life: once as a kid when my grandfather had a heart attack and another time in high school when I sprained my ankle. Despite being an underwriter for outpatient healthcare facilities and my general penchant for clumsiness, I had minimal experience actually using these types of facilities.

While it is not feasible to visit every type of outpatient or even urgent care facility (especially not in Boston where healthcare facilities are nearly as common as Dunks), I wanted to use data to learn more about how people use emergency care. To start, I pulled state and countrywide data from the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/emergency-room-visits-by-ownership/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D), cleaned it up and after some exploration, made visualizations showing what I found. [Here](image/raw_data_kff.csv) is the dataset I started with and [here](image/raw_data/csv) is what it looked like after some simple modifications in Excel. From there, I finished modifying it to my preference in R.

As you can see, my initial assumption about emergency room visits decreasing was incorrect. Seeing these graphs left me with a lot of questions, primarily, why are visits on the rise and why did the implementation of the ACA not have any noticeable effect of the overall trend? I have also been confused by mixed information online whether or not emergency room visits are rising or falling.
