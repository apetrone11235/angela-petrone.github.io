title: Emergency! Emergency!

On a chilly spring day in 2017, I got a call from my roommate. I was in my office and immediately knew that something was wrong because, as two twentysomething girls, we never talked on the phone. When I picked up, her voice was strained and nearly overwhelmed by background noise. She had been rock climbing at a local gym with some friends when she had fallen and landed awkwardly on her arm. Despite her best attempts to convince the group to let her get an Uber to the hospital, someone had called an ambulance and she was in transit to the nearest emergency room.

As I got on the subway to meet her at the hospital, I realized that I had only been to the emergency room twice in my life: once as a kid when my grandfather had a heart attack and another time in high school when I sprained my ankle. Despite being a healthcare facility underwriter and my general penchant for clumsiness, I had minimal experience actually using urgent care facilities.

For a bit of added context, in my role as a healthcare underwriter, I was responsible for my company's outpatient healthcare facilities product. Across the commercial insurance industry, this type of product has been one of the fastest growing and most profitable. Its success has largely been attributed by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with the idea that, since people have increased access to insurance, they use standalone urgent and primary care facilities more often because these services are now relatively cheaper. In turn, this increased demand for outpatient care presumably generated the need for more outpatient facilities, and since these facilities need medical malpractice insurance, my product line was booming (especially in Boston where healthcare facilities are nearly as common as Dunks). Although I had some different thoughts on this in my college thesis, I readily accepted this assumption, along with the idea that trips to the emergency room must be on the decline since there are more alternatives for critical care and I have yet to meet someone who would willingly go to the ER if another option was available to them.

I wanted to use data to learn more about how people use emergency care so I pulled state and countrywide data from the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/emergency-room-visits-by-ownership/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D), cleaned it up, and after some exploration made visualizations showing what I found.

Here is a simple illustration of how the number of visits per 1000 people changed over time across the whole country:

As you can see, my initial assumption about emergency room visits decreasing was incorrect. Seeing this graph left me with a lot of questions, primarily, why are visits on the rise and why did the implementation of the ACA not have any noticeable effect of the overall trend? And why did I along with so many of my colleagues and clients not question this assumption earlier? 

From here, I decided to take a closer look at available literature on the subject as well as the impact on a more local basis by investigating how the rate in Pennsylvania (where I am originally from) changed compared to Massachusetts (where I live now and had insurance exchanges before the ACA was implemented).

Stay tuned for the part 2
