On a chilly spring day in 2017, I got a call from my roommate. I was in my office and immediately knew that something was wrong because, as two twentysomething girls, we never talked on the phone. When I picked up, her voice was strained and nearly overwhelmed by background noise. She had been rock climbing at a local gym with some friends when she had fallen and landed awkwardly on her arm. Despite her best attempts to convince the group to let her get an Uber to the hospital, someone had called an ambulance and she was in transit to the nearest emergency room.

As I got on the subway to meet her at the hospital, I realized that I had only been to the emergency room twice in my life: once as a kid when my grandfather had a heart attack and another time in high school when I sprained my ankle. Despite being a healthcare facility underwriter and my general penchant for clumsiness, I had minimal experience actually using urgent care facilities.

For a bit of added context, in my role as a healthcare underwriter, I was responsible for my company's outpatient healthcare facilities product. Across the commercial insurance industry, this type of product has been one of the fastest growing and most profitable. Its success has largely been attributed by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with the idea that, since people have increased access to insurance, they use standalone urgent and primary care facilities more often because these services are now relatively cheaper. In turn, this increased demand for outpatient care presumably generated the need for more outpatient facilities, and since these facilities need medical malpractice insurance, my product line was booming (especially in Boston where healthcare facilities are nearly as common as Dunks). Although I had written about how increased access to healthcare and insurance changes consumer behavior in my [college thesis](https://github.com/apetrone11235/apetrone11235.github.io/blob/master/Compiled%20Thesis%20Work.pdf), I readily accepted this assumption, along with the idea that trips to the emergency room must be on the decline since there are more alternatives for critical care and I have yet to meet someone who would willingly go to the ER if another option was available to them.

I wanted to use data to learn more about how people use emergency care so I pulled state and countrywide data from the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/emergency-room-visits-by-ownership/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D), cleaned it up, and after some exploration made visualizations showing what I found.

To start, here is a simple illustration of how the number of visits per 1000 people changed over time across the whole country:

As you can see, my initial assumption about emergency room visits decreasing was incorrect. Seeing this graph left me with a lot of questions, primarily, with the rate of ER visits on the rise, what is really going on in the outpatient healthcare market? 

## Medicaid or the Lack Thereof ##

Thinking about this inital observation brought me back to my internships at [Independence Blue Cross](https://www.ibx.com/). If you looked at my [resume](https://angela-petrone.com/img/Resume2019.pdf), you'll know that I worked there for three summers, the first of which coincided with the [2012 Supreme Court ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) that decided that the constitutionality of the individual mandate portion of the ACA but determined states that opted not to expand Medicaid coverage could not lose all of their federal Medicaid funding. Since I was living in notoriously purple Pennsylvania at the time and we had a Republican governor, there was a lot of uncertainty, especially in the personal health insurance world, about how these changes would play out. 

Ultimately, Governor Corbett opted not to expand Medicaid coverage and the people of Pennsylvania opted not to reelect him. In the meantime, I was lucky enough to get a thorough education on how the new law would impact the local Philadelipha communities which is home to a large population of people who rely on Medicaid. All of this is to say, it occurred to me that Medicaid is an especially overlooked type of insurance coverage in the commerical insurance industry but it would be very useful to understand how consumers' approach to seeking care has changed through this lens. 

Fast forward to today, when I found a fascinating and upsetting article on [NPR's website](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/14/722199393/no-mercy-how-a-kansas-town-is-grappling-with-its-hospitals-closure) that discussed the impact of a Kansas hospital closing due to lack of quality care and eventually occupancy. It is not hard to understand why patients would decide to travel a longer distance to receive better care that is equally covered by their private insurance plans when they need non-urgent care. However, many people in Bourbon County, Kansas (and many other counties across the country) rely on Medicaid and don't always have access to a car, so traveling out of town or across state lines is not an option for non-urgent care and out of the question in emergency situations.
