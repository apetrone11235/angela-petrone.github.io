Now let's look at Harper's performance throughout the course of his career and see what we can predict about his performance going forward using the same metrics. 

The first thing I noticed when I was reviewing the data was that Harper has been very inconsistent. 
*Note that I also included his 2011 numbers when he was still in the minors to bolster my dataset*

Most noteably, he had a very unproductive season in 2014 due to a knee injury that required surgery. This jumped out at me in large part because he is still so young and the Phillies are considering signing him for the next 10 years. To be fair, he bounced back in 2015 and led the league in runs, home runs, OBP and SLG. However, this inconsistency made it difficult to develop a predictive model for Harper's production so I decided to play around with other stats to see if I could make any significant predicitons.

I figured that there should be some correlation between how many runs Harper produced and the total bases (TB) he reached in a season. In fact, the two stats are highly correlated at 0.956.
