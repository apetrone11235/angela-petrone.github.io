Now let's look at Harper's performance throughout the course of his career and see what we can predict about his performance going forward using the same metrics. 

The first thing I noticed when I was reviewing the data was that Harper has been very inconsistent. Most noteably, he had a very unproductive season in 2014 due to a knee injury that required surgery.

This jumped out at me in large part because he is still so young and the Phillies are considering signing him for the next 10 years. This inconsistency made it difficult to develop a predictive model for Harper's production but I was able to add in some other factors to strength it.
