## How good is Bryce Harper?

My main objective in evaluating Bryce Harper's value to the Phillies was determining how good he is offensively, especially with regards to run production. I was much less concerned with his defensive ability because, as an outfielder, he is unlikely to change the score of a given game on the field. Of course, a truly terrible outfielder who misses routine fly balls and can't make a decent through to the plate will cost their team some runs, but considering Harper is not a liability in the outfield, I chose to focus on his hitting.

As I outlined in part 1 of this project, the key offensive stats I looked at were Runs, OBP, and SLG. Considering Harper has been in the league for only 8 years, I wanted to get a sense of his average run production before trying to make any assumptions about his future production.

The first thing I noticed about this graph was the inconsistency in production over not that many years. In 2014 when he was just 22, Harper only played 100 games due to a knee injury that required surgery. It seems like the surgery was not just successful but also gave him either a lot of motivation to perform in 2015 or hitting super powers, because in 2015 he came back to lead the league in runs and HRs, lead the entire MLB in OBP and SLG, was an All Star, the NL MVP, and won the NL [Silver Slugger Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Slugger_Award).

While these two seasons are definitely critical for understanding Harper as an offensive player, they make his stats pretty challenging to predict. For example, when I took a look at the relationship between runs scored, OBP and SLG, I got this:
