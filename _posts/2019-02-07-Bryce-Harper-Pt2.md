## How good is Bryce Harper?

My main objective in evaluating Bryce Harper's value to the Phillies was determining how good he is offensively, especially with regards to run production. I was much less concerned with his defensive ability because, as an outfielder, he is unlikely to change the score of a given game on the field. Of course, a truly terrible outfielder who misses routine fly balls and can't make a decent through to the plate will cost their team some runs, but considering Harper is not a liability in the outfield, I chose to focus on his hitting.

As I outlined in part 1 of this project, the key offensive stats I looked at were Runs, OBP, and SLG. Considering Harper has been in the league for only 8 years, I wanted to get a sense of his average run production before trying to make any assumptions about his future production.
