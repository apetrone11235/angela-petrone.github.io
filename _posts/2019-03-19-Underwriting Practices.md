title: How can we make underwriting practices more efficient?

Historically, telling people that I work for an insurance company has not gone well for me. Of all the industries that people like to complain about, insurance is pretty high up. In my experience, people's biggest complaints are that they feel like they're paying for something that doesn't seem to work the way they think it should. And premiums are always going up! How could I be part of such a thing?!

To be fair, the nature of insurance is confusing. Prices are determined using predictive models consumers never get to see and the products are essentially pages of legalise. In my nearly four years of working in insurance, I have gotten a very detailed look at how insurance products are created, priced and sold. The two biggest takeaways I have from this experience are:

  1) Insurance companies are not ripping you off. In fact, most companies are barely breaking at year end. >>EVIDENCE
  2) There must be ways to improve the underwriting process to help decrease administrative costs and in turn decrease premiums
  
These observations are clearly related, so I decided to try and find a data-driven solution to a major inefficiency I faced as a [medical malpractice] (https://www.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_med_mal.htm) underwriter, which was how I tried to identify accounts I wanted to underwrite. 

### So you write under things?

If you have no idea what an underwriter is or does, don't worry, neither do my parents. Some basic knowledge of the job will be helpful to understanding this post so I will give you a quick lesson. 

First, it is important to note that I will be talking about commercial insurance underwriting (i.e. insurance products for companies), rather than personal lines underwriting (i.e. insurance products for individuals). When it comes to most commercial insurance products, you can't just go online, get a quote and buy the coverage you want. With commerical insurance, customers work through a licensed agent or broker who in turn works with undewriters at insurance carriers to identify coverage needs and get the appropriate products. If this process sounds a little inefficient to you, you are not wrong. However, agents play an important role in making sure their customers don't have coverage gaps and are getting the best price. They also have a deep knowledge of which insurance carriers can provide certain products and what information underwriters need to properly price the requested insurance coverage. These are all things that you might not know if you are the CEO of a large hospital or the founder of a life science start up, but definitely need professional help with in order to make sure your business doesn't get destroyed by an unexpected, catastrophic loss.

As a med mal underwriter, I received submissions from agents that outlined what the company seeking insurance does, what their loss history looked like, and a variety of metrics that would allow me to evaluate the size of the potential exposure. These metrics could be things like how many patients the facility sees in a year, how much medical supplies and pharmaceuticals they keep on the premises, how many doctors they employ, etc. From there, I would research the facility to see if there were any aspects of their operations that didn't fit within my underwriting guidelines
