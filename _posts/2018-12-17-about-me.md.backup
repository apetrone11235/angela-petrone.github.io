Hello and thank you for visiting my website. My name is Angela and I am originally from Philadelphia. I moved up to Boston to attend Boston College where I graduated in 2015 with a degree in Economics. Right after graduation, I started to work as a medical malpractice underwriter at CNA Insurance. In November 2017, I joined the CNA Surety team in order to learn about corporate finance and expand my risk analysis knowledge. 

In my spare time, I am an avid distance runner, ballroom dancer, and oboist. I also dedicate my time to serving on two young professionals boards: _Back on My Feet Boston_ and the _Insurance Industry Charitable Foundation_. I take my responsibilities within these organizations very seriously because I am a big believer in the importance of corporate social responsibility and partnerships between large companies and not-for-profits. These beliefs were instilled in me when I was an intern at the Independence Blue Cross Foundation during college because I was able to see the impact of our work in the community by visiting health clinics that had been opened because of the grants we provided. Since then, I have been especially interested in exploring what large insurance companies can do for the communities they serve.

In my senior year of college, I did my thesis work on the impact of health insurance policy reform in China on rural-to-urban migrants. I chose this topic because it allowed me to look not only at healthcare policy from an economic perspective, but I also had to dig into the social and cultural issues surrounding economic choices. After completing my paper, it was clear to me that effective policy can only be created through the confluence of understanding all three of these elements for a given population.

Since my current role as an underwriter doesn't focus on policy issues or data analysis, I made this website so that I had a place to express my views and personal projects.
