title: Is Bryce Harper Worth it for the Phillies?
published: true
---

While most of Boston is getting ready to watch the Patriots in what feels like their 873rd Super Bowl appearance, I have been dealing with my feelings about the Eagles being days away from losing their reigning champion status by listening to Phillies trade rumors. The biggest story from this beat is without a doubt the potential for us to pick up Bryce Harper from our NL East rival the Nationals. 

To be honest, I am not excited about this. I know Harper is a formidable opponent and not having to play against him would be nice, but I have never been a big fan of him and he could just as easily not play against us on the Yankees. He came into the MLB as a 19 year old with great hair and a lot of swagger. For me, it's hard to forget watching him in the outfield as an All Star, wearing a pair of gold cleats and losing a routine fly ball in the lights. Compared to Mike Trout, who's about the same age and made his MLB debut a couple of months before Harper, the difference in maturity and humility is stark. All of this is to say, I get the hype around Harper but I'm not convinced his stats and attitude make him an optimal addition to the Phillies.

As a 26 year old myself who is still waiting to make her MLB debut, I thought I would try to Moneyball this situation to see if my personal bias against Harper is unwarranted. To do this, I used what I've been learning in my spare time from the helpful folks at [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/index.htm) to model the Phillies' and Harper's stats to see how he could potentially contribute. I also pulled out the stats of Nick Williams and Oduble Herrara who the Phillies are most likely to trade to make room for Harper, should they sign him. 

A couple words about the model:

If you're unfamiliar with Moneyball, I highly recommend you read the book and/or watch the movie. It's a great and true story of how a Harvard statistician (Paul DePodesta) helped the Oakland A's make the playoffs an astounding number of years in a row on a tight budget. Essentially, DePodesta broke down the game into a couple of key components, built a highly effective predictive model and worked with the general manager, Billy Beane, to recruit players who had excellent numbers in certain areas while eschewing traditional methods of scouting and big name players.

*Fun Philly Fact: Former Phillies GM Ed Wade (an actor, sadly not the actual guy) makes a brief appearance in the movie agreeing to trade for Jeremy Giambi. This was a terrible decision because the guy had stones for hands and was a disaster in the locker room, so you may understand why I'm a little wary of the Phillies' front office decisions.*

The tricky thing I ran into early on is that Harper has only been in the MLB since 2012. While there are an incredible amount of stats available for each of those years, only having 7 years of statistics isn't ideal. The same goes for Herrara and Williams. Fortunately, the Phillies are one of the oldest teams in any sport, so I had no trouble mining [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) for franchise data. 

A helpful component of this project was that since the Phillies and Nationals are in the same division of the National League, comparing numbers between Harper, Herrara and Williams was fairly apples to apples, since they play many of the same teams at a similar frequency. 

It’s also important to keep in mind that Herrara’s contract has his 2019 salary at $5MM (not including a $350,000 signing bonus; this is also a five-year contract) and Williams is at the MLB minimum of $553,000. We don’t know what Harper will sign for, but we do know that he’s leaving the Nationals after making $21.6M last year, so we can safely assume it will be a massive contract.
