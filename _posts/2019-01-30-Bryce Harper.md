title: Is Bryce Harper Worth it for the Phillies?
published: true
---

In order to distract myself from the fact that the Eagles are no longer the reigning Super Bowl Champs, I have been listening to Phillies trade rumors. The biggest story from this beat is without a doubt the potential for us to pick up Bryce Harper (OF, 26 y.o.) from our NL East rival the Nationals. 

To be honest, I am not excited about this. I know Harper is a formidable opponent and not having to play against him would be nice, but I have never been a big fan of him and he could just as easily not play against us on the Yankees. He came into the MLB as a 19 year old with great hair and a lot of swagger. Compared to Mike Trout, who's about the same age and made his MLB debut the season before Harper, the difference in maturity and humility is stark. All of this is to say, I get the hype around Harper but I'm not convinced his stats and attitude make him an optimal addition to the Phillies.

As a 26 year old myself who is still waiting to make her MLB debut, I thought I would try to Moneyball this situation to see if my personal bias against Harper is unwarranted. To do this, I used what I've been learning in my spare time from the helpful folks at [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/index.htm) to model the Phillies' and Harper's stats to see how he could potentially contribute. I also pulled out the stats of Nick Williams (RF, 25 y.o. and Odubel Herrara (CF, 27 y.o.) who the Phillies are most likely to trade to make room for Harper, should they sign him.

**Moneyball:**

If you're unfamiliar with Moneyball, I highly recommend you read the book and/or watch the movie. It's a great and true story of how a Harvard statistician (Paul DePodesta) helped the Oakland A's make the playoffs an astounding number of years in a row on a tight budget. Essentially, DePodesta broke down the game into a couple of key components, built a highly effective predictive model and worked with the general manager, Billy Beane, to recruit players who had excellent numbers in certain areas while eschewing traditional methods of scouting and big name players.

*Fun Philly Fact: Former Phillies GM Ed Wade (an actor, sadly not the actual guy) makes a brief appearance in the movie agreeing to trade for Jeremy Giambi. This was a terrible decision because the guy had stones for hands and was a disaster in the locker room, so you may understand why I'm a little wary of the Phillies' front office decisions.* 

**The "money" part of Moneyball**

In Harper's first season in the MLB, he was making the Major Leagues minimum salary which was $500,000 at the time. While we don’t know how much Harper will ultimately sign for in 2019, we do know that he’s leaving the Nationals after making $21.6M last year, so we can safely assume it will be a massive contract. The latest speculations are $300M over 10 years.

On the other hand, Herrara is signed with the Phillies through 2021 with options through 2023. His contract is for $30MM over 5 years (not including a $350,000 signing bonus so his 2019 salary is $5,350,000). Williams makes the MLB minimum of $553,000 with no long-term contract.
