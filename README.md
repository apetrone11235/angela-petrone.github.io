# Angela's Website for Personal Data Projects

I created this website to display projects I am doing in my spare time using R. The topics range from everyday things that I am curious about, like baseball, to more serious questions about policy that I hope will help me form the basis of my future academic endeavors. All of the ideas expressed on this site are mine and do not reflect the position of any other person or organization. 

The format of this site is from [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). I would like to give special thanks to my sisters for all of their help and insight as I have been trying to improve my programming skills.
